# Project structure

The project adheres to the Nx monorepo structure enriched with the DDD approach.

Nx is a powerful set of extensible dev tools for modern JavaScript applications. At its core, NX provides a structured approach to building and managing complex applications within a monorepository (monorepo) architecture.

DDD describes an approach that bridges the gap between the requirements for complex software systems and an appropriate application design. Historically, DDD came with two disciplines: tactical design and strategic design. Tactical design proposes concrete concepts and design patterns. Meanwhile most of them are common knowledge. Examples are concepts like layering or patterns like factories, repositories, and entities.

By contrast, strategic design deals with subdividing a huge system into smaller, decoupled, and less complex parts. This is what we need to define an architecture for a huge system that can evolve over time.

Even though both approaches are widely used in the backend world, on the frontend side, we are primarily focusing on strategic design.
